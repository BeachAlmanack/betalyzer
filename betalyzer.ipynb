    "## Structure\n",
    "Betalyzer is a Flask app but there are several files.\n",
    " - **`betalyzer.py`:** All of the business logic is in this file.\n",
    " - **`app.py`:** This is the Flask app and handles the execution of the web app.\n",
    " - **`templates/index.html`:** We only needed one page -- the index page -- for this project.\n",
    " - **Pickles:** For performance reasons, I do not want to fetch the data and recalculate the historical betas every time a user opens the web page. So I store the calculations in pickle files, including `df_tickers` for all the tickers, `df_betas` as a timeseries for historical betas by ticker and `df_changes` as a timeseries for daily changes by ticker.\n",
    " - **`betalyzer.ipynb`:** This file. This is the resulting report.\n",
    " - **`play.ipynb`:** I have left the play Notebooks in place where I did some of my sratch work, though none of them are actually used."

    "## Data Issues\n",
    "There were a variety of data issues that I came across. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, getting a list of current tickers was a bit tricky. Neither Quandl nor Yahoo Finance provided an easy way to accomplish this. However, NASDAQ publishes a daily list of securities traded on its exchange. `nasdaq_url` in `betalyzer.py` sets this source. So I only have NASDAQ stocks in Betalyzer currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, according to Quandl, their best data source for daily stock price data is WIKI. However, WIKI does not have ETFs, and to calculate the market move, I would like to use an ETF such as SPY. Therefore, I use WIKI for all individual stock price data, and I use GOOG for SPY data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, GOOG is not perfect. It does not seem to have a very good calendar in the API, and contains non business days (primarily holidays as opposed to weekends). Also, GOOG does not adjust for stock splits and dividends. Since we only get SPY from GOOG, the main issue is that it is not dividend adjusted. Meanwhile, WIKI has adjusted for dividends and splits as we use the column 'Adj Close'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, there is missing data in WIKI from Quandl. For example, GOOG only starts in mid 2014. Also, a ticker like 'CELG' (randomly chosen) has several missing data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[In] df_changes['CELG'][df_changes['CELG'].isnull()]\n",
    "[Out]\n",
    "Date\n",
    "2014-10-02   NaN\n",
    "2014-11-05   NaN\n",
    "2014-12-03   NaN\n",
    "2014-12-08   NaN\n",
    "2014-12-11   NaN\n",
    "2014-12-29   NaN\n",
    "2015-01-07   NaN\n",
    "2015-01-09   NaN\n",
    "2015-01-16   NaN\n",
    "2015-01-27   NaN\n",
    "2015-02-05   NaN\n",
    "2015-02-06   NaN\n",
    "2015-07-13   NaN\n",
    "Name: CELG, dtype: float64\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use .fillna(0) to solve this issue temporarily, but I have not done this, so missing data will appear as gaps in the beta calculation charts."

    "## Calculation Engine\n",
    "I spent quite a bit of time optimizing the calculation engine. We break the steps down:\n",
    " - Get Tickers: The first step is to get a list of relevant tickers. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an easy way to do this using Quandl or Yahoo Finance, but I did find that NASDAQ publishes a daily list of securities traded on its exchange. `nasdaq_url` in `betalyzer.py` sets this source. `read_nasdaq()` "

    "## Extensions\n",
    "Should this have been a production level project, here are some extensions that could have been added:\n",
    " - **Additional data:** We currently only get NASDAQ data. We should get data from NYSE as well to cover most equities. We also do not get ETFs. Additionally, there are some shortcomings in the adjustments to the SPY data (it is not total return) that need to be taken into account. \n",
    " - **Datastore:** The data is currently stored in pickled DataFrames, and only the data we need (the rest is discarded). Ideally, we'd move this to a Postgres database, and perhaps Redshift if the data starts moving beyond a few GBs, for optimal performance. \n",
    " - **Recalculation:** Currently, on recalculation, all data is fetched from Quandl, even data that we've used before, and all calculations are made again. Ideally, we should only fetch new data and calculate based on the new data. \n",
    " - **Auto-recalculation:** Currently, only manual recalculation is supported. I would add a process that auto-recalculates every business day at a certain time when both NASDAQ and Quandl have updated their data. Perhaps an asynchronus process and a scheduler (Celery and Celery Beat is what I've used in the past) could help here. "
